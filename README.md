# Django REST API challenge
Implement service with API described in api.yaml file.

## The task
- In [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) implement service with REST API defined in file api.yaml  
- All endpoint should be public - authentication is not required
- Proper error handling is out of scope of this challenge, therefore Error responses codes and contents aren't defined and are up to the developer
- Any database engine can be used, but SQLite is recommended for matter of simplicity
- Pagination should be handled by limit and offset parameter, default limit size is up to the developer
- All files and source code including comments should be written in English
- Use a packaging and dependency management tool of your choice (venv, poetry,...)

## Expected result
- Public git repository with all source and tooling files and description how to install and run it
- Keep a "development journal", noting any decisions you made, or difficulties you encountered
- Ideally, we would like to see result in a week
- Don't public anything from this archive
